#Apply basic Python arithmetic operations and variable assignments 
#to calculate the simple interest on a given principal amount, rate of interest, and time.

principal = 1000    # amount expressed in dollars    
rate = 0.05         # 5% interest rate
time= 3            # time expressed in years        

interest = principal * rate * time
