# Backend Web Development

Welcome to my ALX Africa Backend Web Development programme repository! Here, I will be showcasing the skills, tools, and projects Iâ€™ve worked on throughout the program, which has deepened my understanding of backend web development.

### Skills Acquired
During the programme, I learned a variety of backend technologies and concepts that have strengthened my understanding of building scalable and efficient web applications. Below is a summary of the skills I have acquired:

- **Django**: Mastered Django framework for building robust web applications with Python.
- **RESTful APIs**: Developed and consumed RESTful APIs, applying the principles of HTTP methods, status codes, and request/response structures.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: Specialized in DRF to create advanced, customizable APIs with authentication, permissions, and serializers.
- **Postman**: Utilized Postman to test and debug APIs, ensuring endpoints are working as expected.
- **Version Control**: Gained experience with Git and GitHub to manage and track changes to projects.
- **Collaborative Work**: Worked alongside other developers and communicated effectively to complete tasks, share ideas, and solve problems.

### Tools & Technologies Used
- **Django**  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- **Postman**
- **SQLite / mySQL (Database)**
- **Git/GitHub (Version Control)**
- **Python (Programming Language)**

### Capstone Project: E-Learning API
For my final project during my time at ALX, I developed an **E-Learning API** to support the backend functionality of an online learning platform. This API allows users to interact with various resources like courses, programs, and user profiles. Details of the porject can be found [here](https://github.com/abenezer-s/e_learning_api.git).
